# Family Friday app

Randomly divide your team up into small groups.

### Setup

Before firing up the CLI, you must initialize the application by running
`./bin/setup`. This will set up the database that persists employees

### Usage

To start the command line interface, run `bin/start` with no arguments.

You can enter the following commands

* `add <first_name> <last_name>` - adds a new employee
* `echo [arg1, [arg2, ...]]` - print out the arguments
* `groups` - print out groups of employees generated randomly
* `help` - list available commands
* `list` - list all employees
* `quit` - exit the CLI
* `size` - count the number of employees
